Official iFixit Android App v2.9.2
===========================

This app is a native Android version of the iFixit website including:

* Device hierarchy browsing
* Answers and guide lists for devices
* Guide view
* Viewing and adding comments on guides
* Media manager integration: viewing and uploading of images
* Guide lists for favorites, featured, and teardowns
* Guide creation and editing
* Syncing guides for offline viewing

## Installation

Start by cloning the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/iFixit/iFixitAndroid.git

Copy `gradle.properties.base` to `gradle.properties`. This contains all of the
values necessary to build the app in debug mode. To build the app in release
mode, update the necessary keystore information and symlink
`App/sites/{siteName}/keystore` to your keystore like so:

    ln -s /path/to/keystore App/sites/ifixit/keystore

Open `build.gradle` in your IDE of choice or build it on the command line by
invoking gradle commands such as `gradle installIfixitDebug`.

## Acknowledgements

* [okhttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
* [otto](https://github.com/square/otto)

The complete list of dependencies can be found in the [build.gradle][build.gradle] file.

## Contributing

We have a small development team, and don't have the resources to implement
all of the features we would like to ourselves. We'd love help! If there is
any feature you would contribute, fork our code and hack away!

Got an awesome feature idea that we don't have an API to support yet? Post the
request on [iFixit Meta][meta] and we'll add it to our to-do list.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
